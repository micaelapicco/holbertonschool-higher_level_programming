## Requierements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3 (version 3.8.5)`
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
- All your classes should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')`
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation `(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
